# Lecture Announcement

The visit to Mälardalen University, Sweden, will take place on December 16, 2024. The lecture will cover our research on global estimation of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) potential.

## About the Lecture

**Title**: Global Estimation of Building-Integrated Facade and Rooftop Photovoltaic Potential by 3D Building Data

**Abstract**: This research tackles the challenges of estimating Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) potential across various temporal and spatial scales, accounting for different geographical climates and urban morphology. We introduce a methodology utilizing 3D building data for evaluating urban BIPV potential, integrating with diverse meteorological data sources to account for dynamic shadow effects. The approach enables the assessment of PV potential on facades and rooftops at different levels—individual buildings, urban blocks, and cities globally. Through an analysis of 120 typical cities, we highlight the importance of 3D building forms, cityscape morphology, and geographic positioning in measuring BIPV potential at various levels. This finding underscores the strategic value of incorporating facade PV applications into urban sustainable energy systems.
