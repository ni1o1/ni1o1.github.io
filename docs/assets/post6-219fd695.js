## Abstract
This study utilizes empirical EV trajectory data to reveal EV charging behavior patterns, providing a new perspective and analytical method for related research. By classifying EVs and analyzing their spatiotemporal characteristics, the study finds that users with higher charging reliance exhibit stronger usage regularity. The accessibility of charging facilities significantly affects EV user charging behavior. There is a notable gap between potential and actual charging demand in cities, indicating significant potential for daytime charging. This study provides important insights for constructing behavioral models simulating EV daily travel and charging behavior, contributing to the development of efficient charging strategies, energy usage plans, and strategic planning of urban EV charging infrastructure.

## Introduction
The development of electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. However, challenges such as insufficient charging infrastructure, long wait times, high costs, and power demands continue to hinder their widespread adoption. Understanding EV charging demand and user behavior is essential for effectively designing infrastructure. This study aims to fill research gaps by analyzing EV charging behavior, energy usage, and potential charging demand using empirical EV trajectory data, aiming to reveal long-term charging patterns and energy consumption patterns.

## Findings
**Finding 1**: Users with higher charging reliance exhibit stronger usage regularity. The regularity of user charging habits follows a normal distribution, with EV users who have charging facilities at both home and work locations and higher battery capacities demonstrating more consistent behavior.
**Finding 2**: Power loads of EV fleets vary significantly among different vehicle types, charging facility accessibility, and usage regularity. City charging load peaks occur during nighttime hours, with EV energy usage concentrated during the day and charging demand increasing at night. There is a temporal difference between potential and actual charging demand, indicating significant potential for increased daytime charging.
**Finding 3**: Power loads in certain areas vary between different land use attributes. Charging facility spatial distribution is uneven, with charging peaks observed at night in job centers and residential communities. Potential charging demand in urban centers is more concentrated than actual charging demand.
**Finding 4**: Daily travel and charging characteristics of EVs vary based on charging facility accessibility and vehicle types. PHEVs tend to have more trips, larger travel duration variance, and longer daily travel distances compared to BEVs. Charging facility accessibility influences vehicle travel behavior, with more convenient facilities leading to higher charging frequencies. SOC distributions at the start of charging differ between BEVs and PHEVs.
**Finding 5**: Daily usage of EV fleets conforms to certain rules that can be described by probabilistic models. Optimal fitting distribution models and parameters for various indicators have been determined, and the distribution of indicators for different EV groups follows certain rules and can be described using the same distribution.

## Conclusion
This study reveals EV charging behavior patterns through empirical trajectory data, providing a new perspective and analytical method for related research. The findings demonstrate that users with higher charging reliance exhibit stronger usage regularity, charging facility accessibility significantly affects EV user charging behavior, and there is a notable gap between potential and actual charging demand in cities, indicating significant potential for increased daytime charging. These insights contribute to the development of behavioral models simulating EV daily travel and charging behavior, supporting the development of efficient charging strategies, energy usage plans, and strategic planning of urban EV charging infrastructure.
