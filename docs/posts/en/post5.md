# Project Granted by the 76th Batch of the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation General Grant

## Project Title

Research on the Spatiotemporal Characteristics and Evolution Mechanisms of Urban Charging Infrastructure System Resilience Based on Multi-Source Spatiotemporal Data

## Introduction

This project addresses the critical strategic issue of advancing the high-quality development of China’s electric vehicle industry. Driven by multi-source spatiotemporal data, it focuses on studying the resilience of urban charging infrastructure networks. Utilizing high-resolution human mobility and electric vehicle trajectory data, the project observes the spatiotemporal behaviors of different types of electric vehicles over extended time periods. This approach aims to reveal the spatiotemporal behavior patterns of electric vehicles in a big data context, reflect the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of charging infrastructure resilience under complex coupling scenarios, and uncover the impact mechanisms of interactions between spatiotemporal behaviors and urban environments on system resilience. The findings will provide scientific insights and crucial support for policy formulation in the construction of charging infrastructure within the context of transportation electrification in China.
