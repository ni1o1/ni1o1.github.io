# Personal Homepage Setup Complete

## Personal Homepage Successfully Deployed on GitHub

Welcome to my personal homepage, which I have developed to showcase my projects. Here, I will share my learning experiences and project insights. Feel free to explore and visit my personal site.

### Technology Stack of the Personal Homepage

This website is built using React and deployed via GitHub Pages. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/ni1o1/ni1o1.github.io). Within the project structure:

- The `src/pages` directory contains all the page content.
- The `src/components` directory houses all the components.

For the News page, I utilize Markdown files to store news content, facilitating easy updates. Each Markdown file follows this format:

```markdown

title: "My First Post"
date: "2024-11-07"

This is the content of my first blog post.
