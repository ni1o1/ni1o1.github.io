### Abstract
Highways account for a significant share of transportation-related CO₂ emissions, yet policy interventions remain underexplored. This paper investigates toll policies' impacts using long-term ETC data, proposing a bottom-up emission estimation framework combining time-series decomposition and causal inference. Results reveal toll discounts significantly increase highway carbon emissions, but freight traffic shifting to highways reduces system-wide emissions by 52g CO₂ per km daily on average.

### Highlights
• Integrated ETC-GIS framework quantifies spatiotemporal emission patterns  
• Causal inference isolates toll policy effects from confounding factors  
• Time-series decomposition reveals lagged policy responses  
• Freight diversion achieves net emission reduction despite highway emission increases  

### Research Gap
Existing studies lack long-term empirical analysis of highway emissions and examination of critical policy events. Fundamental questions remain about how interacting factors affect system-wide emissions and how to disentangle their effects for evidence-based policymaking.

### Key Findings
1. **Methodological Innovation**: Developed an integrative framework coupling ETC data, GIS network modeling and COPERT emission factors, enabling granular emission estimation and robust policy impact assessment through path reconstruction and DID analysis.

2. **Empirical Insights**: Emissions show strong spatial heterogeneity with hotspots around Changchun. Toll policies differentially affect vehicle types - immediate freight response versus lagged passenger adaptation.

3. **Emission Reduction**: DID analysis demonstrates each kilometer of discounted highway travel yields net system-wide reduction of 52g CO₂/day, with freight achieving 0.22 reduction rate versus 0.05 for passenger vehicles.

### Conclusion
The study demonstrates toll incentives can effectively lower system-wide emissions through optimized freight routing, though passenger vehicle induced demand requires careful management. Findings support context-specific policy design balancing emission reduction and operational efficiency.
