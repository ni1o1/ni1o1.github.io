### Abstract
This research tackles the challenges of estimating building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) potential across various temporal and spatial scales, accounting for different geographical climates and urban morphology. We introduce a holistic methodology for evaluating BIPV potential, integrating 3D building footprint models with diverse meteorological data sources to account for dynamic shadow effects. The approach enables the assessment of PV potential on facades and rooftops at different levels—individual buildings, urban blocks, and cities globally. Through an analysis of 120 typical cities around the globe, we highlight the importance of 3D building forms, cityscape morphology, and geographic positioning in measuring BIPV potential at various levels. In particular, within the analyzed areas, our study reveals that the total solar radiation received by facades is highly competitive with that received by rooftops, showcasing an average facade-to-rooftop ratio of 100.7%. Moreover, 35.9% of the facades receive even more total radiation than rooftops, further emphasizing their potential as viable solar energy surfaces. Despite the generally lower conversion efficiency of facade PV systems compared with rooftop installations, our simulation results indicate that the average ratio of facade PV potential to rooftop PV potential remains approximately 68.2%. Additionally, approximately 17.5% of the analyzed samples demonstrate even higher facade PV potentials compared with rooftop installations. This finding underscores the strategic importance of integrating facade PV applications to enhance the overall urban sustainable energy systems strategy.

### Highlights
*   • Integrating global-scale 3D building with diverse datasets to estimate PV potential
*   • Model for calculating shadows on building envelopes at various spatiotemporal scales
*   • Assessing BIPV potential across single buildings, urban blocks, and 120 global cities
*   • Quantitative comparison of facade and rooftop PV potential globally
*   • Open-source code and toolkit empower contributions to renewable energy sector

### Research Gap
As the world grapples with the urgent need to transition to sustainable energy sources, building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) emerge as a promising solution, particularly within urban environments. While the potential of rooftop PV systems is well recognized, the energy generating capacity of building facades remains significantly underestimated and underutilized. This research addresses this gap by quantifying the BIPV potential of building facades and rooftops across 120 global cities, accounting for diverse urban morphologies and climatic conditions.

### Core Content
*   **Shadow Computation:** The paper proposes a shadow simulation technique based on 3D urban building footprint data to model urban shadows and calculate building shadows at different times and locations.

*   **PV Power Generation Estimation Model:** The model refines solar radiation information by weighting solar insolation at each time point. It integrates direct solar irradiance, sky diffuse, and ground-reflected components, and considers the tilt angle of PV modules, ambient temperature, and energy conversion efficiency.
*   **Global-scale BIPV Potential Estimation:** The study estimates the solar potential of building facades and rooftops globally by integrating global 3D building footprint data and meteorological data. The model evaluates the BIPV potential in 120 global cities and analyzes the impact of different latitudes and building morphologies on BIPV potential.

*   **PV Potential in Global Cities:** The study analyzes the PV potential of 120 global cities and finds that latitude has a significant impact on rooftop PV potential, while facade PV potential is more evenly distributed across different latitudes. The study also finds that building characteristics and morphology are important factors in determining overall PV potential.

### Conclusion
This study presents a methodology for estimating the PV potential of building facades and rooftops within urban 3D morphology. By integrating building footprint models with multi-source meteorological data, the proposed approach simulates shadow casting on 3D buildings. Case studies across 120 cities worldwide reveal that facade PV potential averages about 68.2% compared with rooftops. Remarkably, around 17.5% of the analyzed samples show higher facade PV potentials than rooftop installations. The study highlights the potential of building facades for PV installations and provides a foundation for future research into the economic viability and market viability of facade-integrated PV systems. Furthermore, unlike rooftop PV, facade PV output is less affected by latitude, with urban morphology and building orientation playing a crucial role, emphasizing the importance of these factors for urban planners, architects, and policymakers.
