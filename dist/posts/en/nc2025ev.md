## Background

With the rapid adoption of electric vehicles in Chinese cities, the deployment of ultra-fast charging infrastructure is accelerating. However, the high power demand of ultra-fast charging may significantly impact grid stability and distort existing electricity pricing mechanisms. This study provides an in-depth analysis of these issues to inform policy development.

## Key Findings

By analyzing EV charging data from multiple Chinese cities, this study found:

1. The high power demand of ultra-fast charging is temporally misaligned with current time-of-use pricing policies
2. User charging behavior fails to effectively respond to price signals, exacerbating grid pressure during peak load periods
3. Concentrated deployment of ultra-fast charging stations may cause local grid overload risks

## Policy Implications

The findings indicate a need to revisit existing pricing policies and charging infrastructure planning strategies to ensure the large-scale adoption of EVs is coordinated with stable grid operations.
